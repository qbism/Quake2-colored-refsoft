Quake II v3.24 Unofficial Patch (.exe version 3.2.4.2)
By Knightmare (knightmare66@yahoo.com)

This is a simple, no-frills patch that fixes bugs (including the nVidia 191.x driver
crash) and adds only meager tweaks aside from Ogg Vorbis support.  Intended for
Quake2 purists who have been using the woefully out of date version 3.20, it is not
intended to add new features or be an engine mod in its own right.

It is based on the 3.21 source released by John Carmack in December 2001, with code
by myself, Berserk, CDawg, Pat Aftermoon, Anthony Jacques, David M. Pochron, Dopefish, GuyP, Jitspoe,
MH, MrG, NeVo, Skuller, Riot, R1ch, Psychospaz, Pooy, Sul, and anybody else I forgot.

As this release is not made or supported by id Software or Activision, please don't
ask them for support with this.

You should back up the quake2.exe, ref_gl.dll, and ref_soft.dll files in your Quake2 folder
and the gamex86.dll files in your Quake2/baseq2, Quake2/ctf, Quake2/xatrix, and Quake2/rogue
folders before installing this.
This can be done simply by making a subfolder called "backup" or "old" and moving the
above files there.

To install, just extract this archive into your Quake2 folder.  

To hear Ogg Vorbis tracks ingame, rip the Q2 CD's audio tracks (2-11) to track02-track11.ogg
and put them in baseq2/music.  For the mission pack audio tracks, rip the Ground Zero CD's
audio tracks (2-11) to track12-track21.ogg.  Don't bother ripping the tracks from the
Reckoning CD, as they're a mix of the tracks on the Q2 and Ground Zero CDs.  Everything else
will be taken care of internally.
