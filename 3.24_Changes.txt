3.24 Changes:
- Added Ogg Vorbis support.
- Added support for 44 and 48 KHz sound.
- Added optimizations to world rendering in multitexture mode.
- Added refresh rate control with r_displayrefresh cvar.
- Added refresh rate option to video menu.
- Added writeconfig command to save config changes without exiting.
- Added pak loading security fixes from Q2Pro.
- Added SURF_ALPHATEST (0x02000000) surface flag from KMQuake2.
- Added optimizations to pak file loading.
- Now handles textures as GL_RGBA and lightaps as GL_BGRA on modern OpenGL drivers.
- Added cvar gl_newtextureformat.  Set to 0 to force old texture/lightmap format in case of
  compatibility problems.
- Fixed texture paths with backslashes('\') not loading from inside pak files.
- Fixed graphical corruption that can occur when drop-to-console errors occur while loading a map.
- Fixed crash when conchars.pcx is not found.
- Fixed model culling with pitch and roll.  Added gl_showbbox cvar to show fixed culling bbox.
- Improved handling of OpenGL extension string.
- Screenshots now go up to 999.
- Added screenshot_silent command for silent screenshots.
- Added m_noaccel cvar to disable mouse acceleration.
- Added mouse acceleration option to options menu.
- Restored "disable alt-tab" option to menu.
- Now disables vsync while a map is loading or the video system is restarting, resulting in faster loads.
- Added an option to the video menu to enable or disable non-power-of-2 mipmapped textures.  Some video
  drivers don't properly support NPOT textures and will screw up the mipmaps for these textures.
- Added custom resolution option to video menu.
- Added 2560x1080 video mode.
- Changed default video mode to 3 (640x480) for both OpenGL and software renderers.  Removed modes below
  640x480 from the video menu.
- Added additional server fixes from R1Q2.

3.23 Changes:
- Fixed buffer overflow crash induced by nVidia 191.x drivers.
- OpenGL renderer no longer prints GL_EXTENSIONS string to console on startup.
  This can still be shown with the gl_strings command.
- Increased MAX_OSPATH to 256 characters.  This should improve compatibility when
  Quake2 is installed under C:\Program Files.
- Enlarged s_blocklights array in the OpenGL renderer.
  This allows maps compiled with large -chop sizes to load.
- Increased sky draw distance in the OpenGL renderer to 4600, this can be changed with
  the r_skydistance cvar.
- Added stencil buffering to shadows.
- Added support for non-power-of-two textures.  This can be disabled by setting the cvar
  gl_arb_texturenonpoweroftwo to 0.
- If gl_arb_texturenonpoweroftwo is supported and enabled, cinematics play without loss
  of quality (no column-dropping).
- Added pillarboxing/letterboxing of cinematics on non-4:3 aspect ratios.
- Added support for anisotropic filtering.
- Texture mode and anisotropic filtering can now be changed without a vid_restart.
- Added hardware gamma control.
- Dynamic light cutoff is now adjustable with the cvar r_lightcutoff.  It defaults to 64.
  Lower values will give smoother light, but with a performance penalty.
- Trans surfaces can now move and have animated textures.
- Fixed gl_showtris not working in multitexture mode.
- Fixed dynamic lights not showing up on moving bmodels.
- The console can now be scrolled with the mouse wheel.
- Added wildcard support to the cvarlist command.
- Added improved console command completion.
- Added cvar toggle command.
- Index overflows no longer bomb the game out; instead they cause a warning telling which
  index overflowed. 
- Enlarged command buffer from 8KB to 32KB.  This allows larger .cfg files to be used.
- Now loads pak files from pak0.pak to pak99.pak.
- Added command line option to skip scanning for the game CD to speed up startup time:
  "+set noscanforcd 1"
- Fixed game CD scanning code to work with the official mission packs.
- Fixed player sliding along steep sloped surfaces that meet floors.
- Fixed looped sounds not playing for bmodels without origin brushes.
- Fixed non-dedicated server bombing out out with a WSAECONNRESET error when a client
  crashes or quits without disconnecting first.
- Fixed bomb out when pinging servers with the network cable disconnected.
- Fixed vulnerability to too many clients DoS.
- Fixed bug of not properly disconnected clients potentially being overwritten.
- Fixed hogging of CPU cycles between client frames.  The old behavior can be reverted to
  by setting cl_sleep to 0.
- Fixed rcon_password security issue.
- Various security fixes adapted from R1Q2.
- Client can now autodownload sprites.
- Now draws first-person gun model at up to 160 fov.
- Fixed crash on exiting biggun level.
- Allows player models in the baseq2/players folder still to be found when there are
  player models in the current mod's gamedir.
- No longer creates an autosave when starting a level in deathmatch.
- Increased max savegames to 20.
- Added custom resolution support.  Use r_customwidth and r_customheight to set the custom
  resolution, and set gl_mode or sw_mode to -1 to enable.
- Added new video modes, including widescreen ones.
- Automatically scales FOV for wide aspect ratios.  This can be disabled by setting
  the cvar cl_widescreen_fov to 0.
- Now disables multitexture support by default on Intel graphics.  To enable,
  set gl_intel_allow_multitexture to 1 and restart the renderer (vid_restart).
- Video menu no longer applies changes when pressing ESC, instead the
  "apply changes" action is used, replacing the "cancel changes" action.
- Added missing menu banners (start server, player setup, configure keys).
- Fixed player model being reset to male/grunt after level changes in single player.
- Fixed infinite loop hang with railgun firing through entities with overlapping bounding
  boxes (the eastertank railgun crash).
- Fixed no player models being found when there are loose files in the baseq2/players folder.
- Fixed credits menu so it scrolls past the top of the screen, and then
  starts over once the last line has passed the top.
- Added weapon model to display in player setup menu.

12-22-2001, for source release under GPL licensing:
- Tweaked linux/Makefile for easier build
  added linux/README-3.21-RELEASE

3.21 Changes:
- Support for GL_ARB_multitexture added.  This supports the new multitexture
  extensions and deprecates GL_SGIS_multitexture.
- Linux OpenGL X11 handling completely rewritten.  Support for XF86DGA Mouse
  and fullscreen resolution support added.  Please see the README file for
  Linux about the new features of this handling.
